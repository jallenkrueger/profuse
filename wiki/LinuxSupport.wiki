#summary Information on compiling and using with Linux

= Introduction =

ProFUSE has been tested with Linux 2.6.18/ARM with gcc 4.1.2 and fuse 2.7.4.  That's a debian etch, with a custom compile of fuse 2.7.4 (the standard libfuse2/fuse-dev is based on 2.5.3 and ProFUSE requires 2.6+)


= Compiling =

FUSE 2.6+ must be installed.

{{{
 make -f makefile.linux
}}}

= Usage =

{{{
profuse [options] disk-image mount-folder
}}} 

= Limitations =

The `profuse` command must be run by root (or be setguid root).  By default, the mount dir can only be accessed by the user that mounted it.  If it wasn't you, it will show up as:

{{{
?--------- ? ?      ?           ?            ? mnt
}}}

and will be inaccessible.   The `-oallow_others` flag will give everyone access the mount dir.
