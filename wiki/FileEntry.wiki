  * The `version`/`min_version` fields were deprecated and replaced with filename case information as of IIgs System 5.  Refer to [http://www.umich.edu/~archive/apple2/technotes/tn/gsos/TN.GSOS.008 GS/OS Technote #8]

== storage_type ==

The storage type is stored in the high 4 bits.  Valid values are:

|| $01 || [SeedlingFile Seedling File] ||
|| $02 || [SaplingFile Sapling File] ||
|| $03 || [TreeFile Tree File] ||
|| $04 || [PascalArea Apple II Pascal Area] ||
|| $05 || [ExtendedFile Extended File] ||
|| $0D || [DirectoryFile Directory] ||
|| $0E || Subdirectory Key Block ||
|| $0F || Volume Key Block ||

Type 0x04 and 0x05 were not a part of the original ProDOS specification and are not supported under ProDOS 8.  Refer to [http://www.umich.edu/~archive/apple2/technotes/tn/pdos/TN.PDOS.025 ProDOS Technote #25]

Types 0x0E and 0x0F are not used in the File Entry.
