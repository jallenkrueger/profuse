#summary Information on compiling under Linux

`make -f makefile.linux`

ProFUSE has only been tested on linux 2.6.18/ARM with gcc 4.1.2 and fuse 2.7.4.  That's a debian etch, with a custom compile of fuse 2.7.4 (the standard libfuse2/fuse-dev is based on 2.5.3 and ProFUSE requires 2.6+)


Usage is similar to the `mount` command:

`profuse [options] disk_image mount_dir`

There are some -o options (such as -odebug).  See the fuse documentation for more information.

Notes:

The profuse command itself can only be run by root (unless you root setguid it), and by default, the mount folder can only be accessed by the user that mounted it.  If it wasn't you, it will show up as:

`?--------- ? ?      ?           ?            ? mnt`

and will be inaccessible.
