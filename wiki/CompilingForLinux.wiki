#summary Information on compiling under Linux

`make -f makefile.linux`

ProFUSE has only been tested on linux 2.6.18/ARM with gcc 4.1.2 and fuse 2.7.4.  That's a debian etch, with a custom compile of fuse 2.7.4 (the standard libfuse2/fuse-dev is based on 2.5.3 and ProFUSE requires 2.6+)

Currently, it compiles and runs, but isn't usable yet.  specifically:

files can't be read.
ls gives spurious errors.

This may be related to acl xattr support.
