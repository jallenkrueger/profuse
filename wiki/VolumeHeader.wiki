  * Part of the reserved data is used to store the modification date.  This is not documented but is reportedly specific to the GS/OS ProDOS FST.
  * SOS stores a $76 in the reserved data byte 1 ($10).  This is not documented.
  * Part of the reserved data is used to store `file_name` case information as of IIgs System 5.  Refer to [http://www.umich.edu/~archive/apple2/technotes/tn/gsos/TN.GSOS.008 GS/OS Technote #8].
