#summary Information on the Apple Pascal File System

= Introduction =

UCSD Pascal was a language/virtual machine/OS/File System developed by the University of California, San Diego.  Apple sold an Apple II implementation/port.  IIgs System 6 included a read-only Apple Pascal FST.

The Pascal File system used 512k blocks (like ProDOS) and 2-byte block pointers (which implies a maximum disk size of 32 Meg, like ProDOS).  Files don't store their file size per se, but rather the start block, end block, and size of last block.  This implies a maximum file size of 32 Meg, minus the overhead of boot and volume blocks. 


Block 0 and 1 contain boot code.  Blocks 2--5 contain the volume header and up to 77 file entries.  When a file is deleted, all subsequent records are moved up.

= Volume Header =

All values are little-endian unless specified otherwise.  All blocks are 512 bytes in length.

|| *Name* || *Offset* || *Size* ||
|| first_block || $00 || 2 bytes ||
|| last_block || $02 || 2 bytes ||
|| file_kind || $04 || 1 byte ||
|| reserved || $05 || 1 byte ||
|| volume_name || $06 || 8 bytes ||
|| volume_last_block || $0e || 2 bytes ||
|| file_count || $10 || 2 byte ||
|| load_time || $12 || 2 bytes ||
|| boot_date || $14 || 2 bytes ||
|| reserved || $16 || 4 bytes ||

== fields ==
=== first_block ===

The first block of the directory structure.  This should always be 2.

=== last_block ===

The block _after_ the last block of the directory structure.  (i.e., the next available block). This should always be 6.

=== file_kind ===

This should always be 0.

=== volume_name ===

The volume name, stored with a leading length byte (i.e., a pstring).  The volume name can contain uppercase letters, numbers, and periods.  May be 1--7 character long.

=== volume_last_block ===
The number of blocks on the volume.

=== file count ===

The number of files.  May be 0--77.

=== load_time ===

_????_

=== boot_date ===

The date last booted.


= File Entry =

|| *Name* || *Offset* || *Size* ||
|| first_block || $00 || 2 bytes ||
|| last_block || $02 || 2 bytes ||
|| file_kind || $04 || 1 byte ||
|| status || $05 || 1 byte ||
|| file_name || $06 || 16 bytes ||
|| last_byte || $16 || 2 bytes ||
|| modification_date || $18 || 2 bytes ||


== fields ==

=== first_block ===

The first block of the file

=== last_block ===


The block _after_ the last file block  (i.e., the next available block). 

=== file_kind ===

|| *Name* || *Value* ||
|| untypedfile || $00 ||
|| xdskfile || $01 ||
|| codefile || $02 ||
|| textfile || $03 ||
|| infofile || $04 ||
|| datafile || $05 ||
||  graffile  || $06 ||
|| fotofile || $07 ||
|| securedir || $08 ||

N.B. -- Pascal does not support subdirectories.  `securedir` was added between pascal I and pascal II but was not fully implemented.

=== status ===

Used by wildcard file listings [???]

N.B. -- bit 0 is the status bit, all other bits are reserved.

===file_name ===

The file name, stored with a leading length byte (i.e., a pstring).  The volume name can contain uppercase letters, numbers, and periods.  May be 1--15 character long.


=== last_byte ===

The number of bytes used in the last block.  Should be 1--512.

=== modification_date ===

The date the file was created or last modified.

= Dates =

Dates are stored in a 2 bytes structure:

|| *Field* || *bits* || *range* ||
|| year || 15--9 || 0-100 ||
|| day ||8--4 || 0--31 ||
|| month || 0--3 || 0 -- 12 ||


`yyyy yyyd dddd mmmm`

Year 100 is used to indicate a temporary file.
