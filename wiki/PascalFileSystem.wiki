#summary Information on the Apple Pascal File System

= Introduction =

UCSD Pascal was a language/OS/File System developed by the University of California, San Diego.  Apple sold an Apple II implementation/port.  IIgs System 6 included a read-only Apple Pascal FST.

The Pascal File system used 512k blocks (like ProDOS) and 2-byte block pointers (which implies a maximum disk size of 32 Meg, like ProDOS).  Files don't store their file size per se, but rather the start block, end block, and size of last block.  This implies a maximum file size of 32 Meg, minus the overhead of boot and volume blocks.
