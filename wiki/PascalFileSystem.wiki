#summary Information on the Apple Pascal File System

= Introduction =

UCSD Pascal was a language/virtual machine/OS/File System developed by the University of California, San Diego.  Apple sold an Apple II implementation/port.  IIgs System 6 included a read-only Apple Pascal FST.

The Pascal File system used 512k blocks (like ProDOS) and 2-byte block pointers (which implies a maximum disk size of 32 Meg, like ProDOS).  Files don't store their file size per se, but rather the start block, end block, and size of last block.  This implies a maximum file size of 32 Meg, minus the overhead of boot and volume blocks. 


Block 0 and 1 contain boot code.  Blocks 2--5 contain the volume header and up to 77 file entries.  When a file is deleted, all subsequent records are moved up.

= Volume Header =

All values are little-endian unless specified otherwise.

|| *Name* || *Offset* || *Size* ||
|| first_block || $00 || 2 bytes ||
|| last_block || $02 || 2 bytes ||
|| file_kind || $04 || 1 byte ||
|| reserved || $05 || 1 byte ||
|| volume_name || $06 || 8 bytes ||
|| volume_last_block || $0e || 2 bytes ||
|| file_count || $10 || 2 byte ||
|| load_time || $12 || 2 bytes ||
|| boot_date || $14 || 2 bytes ||
|| reserved || $16 || 4 bytes ||


= File Entry =


|| *Name* || *Offset* || *Size* ||
|| first_block || $00 || 2 bytes ||
|| last_block || $02 || 2 bytes ||
|| file_kind || $04 || 1 byte ||
|| status || $05 || 1 byte ||
|| file_name || $06 || 16 bytes ||
|| last_byte || $16 || 2 bytes ||
|| modification_date || $18 || 2 bytes ||

= Dates =

Dates are stored in a 2 bytes structure:

|| *Field* || *bits* || *range* ||
|| year || 15--9 || 0-100 ||
|| day ||8--4 || 0--31 ||
|| month || 0--3 || 0 -- 12 ||


`yyyy yyyd dddd mmmm`

Year 100 is used to indicate a temporary file.

= File Types =

|| *Name* || *Value* ||
|| untypedfile || $00 ||
|| xdskfile || $01 ||
|| codefile || $02 ||
|| textfile || $03 ||
|| infofile || $04 ||
|| datafile || $05 ||
||  graffile  || $06 ||
|| fotofile || $07 ||
|| securedir || $08 ||

N.B. -- Pascal does not support subdirectories.  `securedir` was a later addition and not implemented.
