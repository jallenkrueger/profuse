#summary Information on Apple II Pascal Areas

= Introduction =

An Apple II Pascal Area is a collection of psuedo-volumes (disk images) for use with the Pascal Profile Manager.

|| storage_type || $04 ||
|| file_name || PASCAL.AREA ||
|| file_type || $EF ||


`key_pointer` is first block of the file.  The file extends to the end of the disk as a contiguous file.  Therefore, only one Pascal Area may exist per ProDOS volume.
